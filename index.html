          fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made
          within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the
          United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such
          Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives
          shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall
          have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be
          made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three,
          Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one,

          Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and
          shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.
